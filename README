This is a library that can be loaded into Varnish for exposing an md5 hash function.  I had a need to call an md5 function on a string and stuff it into a Req header, so I wrote this library and figured out how to integrate it into Varnish.  


To use this library you must take the following steps:

1 - Run "make all" to build the library 
2 - Copy the example from the md5.vcl file in this repo and make sure the path to libmd5varnish.so is in the right place
3 - Use (char*)md5_hash()  via inline C wherever you need to call an MD5 hash 

Example for Varnish 4 you can find inside md5_v4.vcl. In Varnish 4 you must enable -p vcc_allow_inline_c=true to enable inline C, which is disabled by default.
